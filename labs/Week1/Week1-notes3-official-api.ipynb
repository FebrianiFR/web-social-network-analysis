      "My family and I recently visited Edinburgh Castle, and while the experience at the castle itself was fantastic, the parking situation left us feeling a bit frustrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The castle is a true marvel, perched high on Castle Rock with breathtaking views of the city. We spent hours exploring its many fascinating features. The Honours of Scotland (the Crown Jewels) and the Stone of Destiny were definite highlights, and my kids were thrilled to see Mons Meg and the other cannons. The exhibitions were well-curated, and the audio guide added a lot of depth to the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, we parked at the NCP nearby, and the cost was shockingly high—£20 for just 1 hour and 40 minutes! It felt like a rip-off, especially considering how much time you can easily spend at the castle. I’d strongly recommend planning your parking options in advance or considering public transport if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the parking costs, the castle itself is a must-visit. The staff were friendly, the site was well-organized, and the gift shop offered some lovely souvenirs. If you’re visiting with family, wear comfortable shoes, as there’s a fair amount of walking.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, Edinburgh Castle is an incredible destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "One star taken off for parking issues.\n",

The castle's rich history, spanning over 1,000 years, is palpable as you explore its ancient walls, grand halls, and mysterious vaults.\n",
      "\n",

       "  'text': 'Fab used to be the go-to place for cakes, but unfortunately the quality has really declined. Recently I bought a fruit gateau and the presentation was disappointing. Some fruits had fallen off during transport to the outlet and the icing design was distorted. The staff seemed unconcerned and didn’t offer any apology, expecting me to accept it as it was. I had to switch for another cake, but it also had similar issues. Customer service from the main office wasn’t helpful either. It’s a shame, as only their bakery items still maintain the quality Fab used to be known for.',\n",
